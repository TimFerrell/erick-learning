    # allowing the program to continue executing

    # Here we get the result from the input function
    # which is returned as a string, and combine a
    # few strings together to form a single string.
    # Plus symbols are used to combine multiple strings
    # together. The print function only accepts a single
    # string, so we must combine them.

    # This is a basic "for" loop. range() is used in Python to
